            Fuck this bullshit country full of smooth-brain retards. <br />
            In protests, you hear people chanting "Free Free Palestine," well
            this is what I'm chanting, FLEE Palestine.
            <br />
            No one with an ounce of dignity or intelligence would stay here
            voluntarily. we're cursed with an occupier who has the world wrapped
            around it's pinky and people still think they have a chance at
            freedom by fighting or resisting.
            <br />
            We've been resisting since before '48 and nothing but death and pain
            came of it.
            <br />
            Insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over and
            expecting a different result each time every time we try to rise up,
            it's a different outcome but the same final result.
            <br />
            Someone will always die and they end up taking more, the difference
            appears in how they do it - tanks, full military invasion, missiles
            and artillery, arrests - the list of weapons is long, ask Lockheed
            Martin.
            <br />
            I'm not being pessimistic, I'm being realistic.
            <br />
            Sure, you could cause them damage, you could even kill a bunch of
            them, but you cannot deny that they control every single aspect of
            your life.
            <br />
            denying that is just delusional. and that's how some people live.
            they live as if they have a choice, as if they're able to do what
            they want. that's not living, that's dreaming. other people live off
            hope, regardless of where that hope stems from (Religion,
            nationalism, etc.) emotions can only carry you so far, you'll waste
            your life 'feeling' rather than living.
